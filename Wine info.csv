13,"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple.

17,"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino.

160,"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper.

161,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge.

162,"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure.

163,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits.

166,"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors.

175,"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors.

184,"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp.

There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),92,65.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,2010.0
467,"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri.

471,"This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries.

472,"A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it needs serious aging, so don't drink before 2017.",Herdade Grande 2010 Gerações Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano),92,34.0,5,Roger Voss,Portuguese Red,2010.0
473,"Already mature, this is a rich and opulent wine that blends together toast and secondary-fruit aromas with fresh, lively acidity. It has weight and substantial depth and concentration.

474,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley.

475,"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category.

477,"This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature.

The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness.

At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine.

1004,"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries.

1005,"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),88,40.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,2006.0
1006,"Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth.

1007,"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit.

1009,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),88,75.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,2005.0

1014,"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot.

1020,"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold.

1022,"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee),88,25.0,159,Mike DeSimone,White Blend,2013.0

1024,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),88,42.0,26,Matt Kettmann,Sauvignon Blanc,2012.0

1030,"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity.

1032,"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County.

1040,"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster.

1044,"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal.

1475,"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),86,20.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Cabernet Sauvignon,2004.0

1479,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua.

1484,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems.

Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it.

1775,"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced.

1779,"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),91,33.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Rhône-style Red Blend,2011.0

1787,"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors.

1797,"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe.

1805,"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs.

Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley.

1934,"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy.

2104,"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors.

2111,"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard.

2711,"A taut, citrusy and minerally wine from a grape variety that's often more open and fruity, this offering is nonetheless impeccably fresh and clean, picking up some minty notes on the finish.",Merk 2001 Tocai (Friuli Aquileia),87,16.0,135,Joe Czerwinski,Tocai,2001.0
2712,"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that.",Morandé 2001 Edicion Limitada - 66 Barricas Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley),87,,134,Michael Schachner,Cabernet Franc,2001.0
2713,"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),87,18.0,26,,Pinot Gris,2002.0
2714,"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy.",Pradio 1999 Teraje Chardonnay (Friuli Grave),87,10.0,135,Joe Czerwinski,Chardonnay,1999.0

2716,"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish.

2717,"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),87,20.0,70,Michael Schachner,Syrah,2001.0
2718,"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso.

2726,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),86,29.0,26,Matt Kettmann,Zinfandel,2009.0

2732,"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga),86,70.0,26,Virginie Boone,Cabernet Franc,2013.0

2740,"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh.

2772,"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo.

4679,"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones.

4682,"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture.

4683,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),91,20.0,26,Jim Gordon,Pinot Noir,2014.0
4684,"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),91,40.0,26,Jim Gordon,Cabernet Sauvignon,2013.0
4685,"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality.

4691,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),91,24.0,26,Matt Kettmann,Pinot Noir,2015.0

4695,"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum.

4696,"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front.

4708,"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors.

4713,This is a solid mineral and tannin dominated wine. It has black currant fruits which are still buried by the tense tannins and stalky texture.

4723,"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed. Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley),87,30.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Malbec,2013.0
4724,"Black cherry, chipped slate and an earthy nutmeg character show on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling.

4725,"The wine is young, still more structure than fruit. It has firm tannins as well as juicy blackberry fruits.

4728,"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes.

4732,"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.",Château Souverain 1998 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (California),90,25.0,26,,Chardonnay,1998.0

4734,"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some.

4735,"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter.

4737,"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable.

4741,"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),90,25.0,26,,Syrah,1998.0

Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley),90,25.0,26,,Merlot,1997.0
4743,"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes.

4745,"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley),89,40.0,26,,Chardonnay,1998.0
4746,"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities.

4748,"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),89,22.0,26,,Sauvignon Blanc,1999.0
4749,"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint.

5055,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering.

5057,"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish.

6044,"From a bubbly specialist comes this fancy wine, a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Has very forward fruity aromas that are a combo of both varietals. It’s a bit rough, as though the bubbles aren’t fine enough, but that’s comparing it to the best French vintage Champagne, which costs a whole lot more.",Handley 1995 Brut  (Anderson Valley),88,25.0,26,,Champagne Blend,1995.0

6222,"Adding Syrah (Shiraz as the producer calls it) to the blend with Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional gives a strongly perfumed character to this firm, still structured wine.

6238,"This nervy and vibrant wine takes time to reveal the intriguing flavors within.

6256,"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins.

6257,"This is a great Merlot that's intensely concentrated and dazzlingly rich—everything you want a Merlot to be. It's power packed with black cherries, cherry liqueur, cocoa and sweet oak, with firm, hard tannins. That is, of course, the Nickel & Nickel style.

6258,"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis.

6259,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),95,55.0,26,,Chardonnay,2011.0
6260,"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),95,80.0,26,,Cabernet Sauvignon,2010.0
6261,"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar.

6262,"Black and viscous, this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way.

No doubt this Petite will get even more interesting with age.",Sirius 2010 Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),94,45.0,26,Virginie Boone,Petite Sirah,2010.0
6263,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),94,18.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Viognier,2011.0
6264,"Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding.

Christopher 2007 Appassionata Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),94,75.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,2007.0
6265,"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.",Gary Farrell 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),94,55.0,26,,Pinot Noir,2010.0
6266,"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",Silverado 2009 Limited Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),94,150.0,26,,Cabernet Sauvignon,2009.0
6267,"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.",Captûre 2010 Harmonie Red (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),94,120.0,26,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,2010.0
6268,"Perfumed on the nose with heady yellow florals and stonefruit, this is one stunner of a Riesling.

The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend.

It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.",Leonetti Cellar 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),94,90.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Cabernet Sauvignon,2010.0
6270,"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more.

6271,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",Lynmar 2011 La Serenité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),94,70.0,26,,Chardonnay,2011.0

6273,"If there's one California Pinot Noir you cellar this vintage, make it this one. It's a stone-cold guarantee. Light and silky in the mouth, with brisk acidity, it shows rich raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors that are deep and long. Has all the necessary balance to evolve many years, and should start showing bottle development after 2018.",Calera 2010 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),94,80.0,26,,Pinot Noir,2010.0
6274,"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2000 Marguerite Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),94,85.0,106,Paul Gregutt,Pinot Noir,2000.0
6275,"Shows the Von Strasser signature all down the line, with incredibly extracted blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and new French oak flavors, wrapped into hard tannins and brightened with fine acidity.

Best after 2019.",Von Strasser 2010 Vineyard 2131 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),94,80.0,26,,Cabernet Sauvignon,2010.0
6276,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),94,55.0,26,,Chardonnay,2011.0
6277,"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been.

6278,"A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County. The wine is light in texture, with savory wild cherry, licorice, sweet tobacco, mocha, bacon and spice flavors. That sounds like a wild assortment,  but somehow it all comes together, in a wine of singular focus and discernment. Drink now–2020.",Failla 2011 Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),94,50.0,26,,Pinot Noir,2011.0
6279,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",Gary Farrell 2010 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),94,45.0,26,,Chardonnay,2010.0
6280,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",Captûre 2010 Révélation Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),94,140.0,26,,Cabernet Sauvignon,2010.0
6281,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins.

Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak.

There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate.

7065,"Aromas of scorched earth, game, burned rubber and a funky whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass and carry over to the dense palate along with raisin, fig, licorice and a gamy note.

7068,"There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so.

7072,"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors.

7089,"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts.

7093,"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency.

7097,Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface.

7107,"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors.

It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir.

7334,"Inky black in color, with hard tannins, this Petite Sirah is drinkable now only because it's so soft in acidity and fruity.

7340,"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish.

7439,"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar.",Imagery 1999 Sunny Slope Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),85,29.0,26,,Merlot,1999.0
7440,"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge. It has a nice chocolatey edge that would be a good partner with dark chocolate desserts.

7444,"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel.

7686,"Loamy, earthy blackberry and plum aromas are woody and attractive. This is loud and lively on the palate, with acidity and tannins making their presence felt.

7687,"Made from a blend of 60% Alicante, 30% Nocera and 10% Calabrese, this wine has aromas of violet, tilled earth, mature plum, prune and black cooking spice.

Made for early drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon.",Hauner 2012 Hierà Red (Salina),90,20.0,193,Kerin O’Keefe,Red Blend,2012.0
7688,"Notes of grass, green pepper and citrus on the nose are followed by a combination of steely minerality and plump grapefruit on the palate in this sophisticated wine.

7689,"At a time when many others have dropped Sangiovese from their portfolios, Amador Foothill remains committed to the great grape of Tuscany. The wine is medium-bodied and soft, somewhat like a warm-climate Merlot, with a pepper edge to the cherry and red currant flavors. It finishes dry and elegant.",Amador Foothill Winery 2005 Estate Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),87,20.0,26,,Sangiovese,2005.0
7690,"This Cabernet-Merlot blend is definitely dominated by spice that takes shape as cumin, turmeric and ground clove.

7692,"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication.",Courtney Benham 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),86,14.0,26,,Sauvignon Blanc,2006.0
7693,"Flavors of bright, ripe black currant fruit and a nose of cinnamon, anise and blackberry recommend this energetic wine from the Wellington region.

7694,"It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.",Bonneau 2005 Epos Meritage (Napa Valley),86,60.0,26,,Meritage,2005.0
7695,"For a basic Tempranillo from Rueda, there's nothing not to like about this wine. It's snappy and fresh, maybe a bit sharp, but not spiky.

7700,"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend.

7701,"Fairly ripe and deep smelling, yet it's more racy and lean in the mouth. There's good berry fruit to this Tempranillo-led wine, but it turns kind of sharp and sheering on the back palate. Freshness and snappy zest are the wine's main characteristics.

7703,"This blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is light and leafy but not dirty or harsh. It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit.

7710,"You can't beat the price of this simple, quaffable red from Oak Lane, and certainly this is a wine that could make for very nice everyday sipping.

7713,"The nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute.

9328,"Dense aromas of earth, berry fruits, latex and animal fur are a touch challenging at first but balance out with airing. This has a crisp, fresh feel despite coming from a hot year.

9329,"This blend is mostly Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon backing it up. Dense, earthy, meaty and lightly roasted on the nose, the palate is mildly tannic, with lively acidity.

9330,"This Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, underbrush, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of roasted coffee beans, all of which carry over to the concentrated palate along with black pepper and clove.

9335,"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable.

9339,"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.",Prospect 772 2012 The Truant G-S-M (Sierra Foothills),89,36.0,26,Jim Gordon,G-S-M,2012.0

9345,"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity.

9347,"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks.

9348,"The vineyard has been source to several wineries including Conn Creek, who had a successful 2002, but this '04 is a let-down.

9353,"Lots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption.",Valsanzo 2006 Damalisco  (Toro),84,13.0,40,Michael Schachner,Tempranillo,2006.0
9354,"Dry and leafy in the Cru Bourgeois sense of Bordeaux. And that makes sense given that it's Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from a cool, tough vintage.

9355,"A strange bird for sure. The blend is 70% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Picapoll. In no way is it common, and truth be told it lags far behind the winery's usually excellent reds. But it does have a lot of kick, body and tropical fruit.

9356,"Big and sweet, with ripe berry aromas, candy and leather on the nose. This wine is a classic fruity joven; it's bulky and easygoing, with black cherry, raspberry and chocolate.

9357,"Rusty in color with a neutral, light-styled nose. This wine shows all of its age via lean apple skin and cherry flavors.

9359,"Osborne is now in Ribera del Duero, and if this wine is an indication of what to expect, then work needs to be done. It has a cheesey nose with no real fruit character. The palate has acidic freshness but also a dearth of substance and a grabby feel. It's not bad wine per se, but in RDD the competition is stiff and this isn't going to draw many converts.",Osborne Selección 2003 Señorio del Cid Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),84,21.0,40,Michael Schachner,Tempranillo,2003.0

9361,"Fairly rough and gaseous at first (and we tried two different samples), although it does soften with time.

9363,"Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold.

9366,"Everyone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour.

9367,"Young, rambunctious Toro is what this is. It's leathery and raw on the nose, with barrel char to boot. The palate is sweet, unctuous and creamy, with candied berry flavors and caramel.

9368,"Vibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon.

9371,"This is a 100% estate wine from the producer's cool-climate sites near the town of Freestone. Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops.

9377,"Blackberry, cassis, mocha and chocolate aromas are typical of fine, modern Malbec, even if this contains 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.

9379,"Black cherries, leather, dried rose petals, rustic cinnamon, bloody meat, graphite, cherry cola and vanilla bean show on the wondrously layered nose of this Steve Clifton bottling.

9380,"The aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and dried herbs are still quite locked up, with the oak out front.

Sullivan,Cabernet Sauvignon,2012.0
9381,"Ripe, rich fruit and bold, mouth dampening tannins express the rugged muscularity of this wine. A blend of classic Bordeaux grape varieties, it highlights pristine black cherry and cassis against a backdrop of spice, cedar, barnyard and tobacco complexities.

9382,"Grown on the producer's 1,800-foot-high, dry-farmed property west of St. Helena from 40-year-old vines, this is a great wine, structured and elegantly designed to highlight cassis, clove and cigar.

9383,"Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar.

9384,"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange.

9385,"Very dark and inky in color, this bottling by Matthias Pippig shows baked black plum and black cherry on the nose as well as a dusting of cocoa and elegant forest spices of juniper and pine.

9481,"A little candied and jumpy on the nose, with floral, grapey aromas. The palate is wide and stocky, with grabby tannins that turn the flavors of bold berry and plum a bit thick.

9774,"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish.

9775,"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza),92,35.0,12,Michael Schachner,Chardonnay,2005.0
9776,"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Beaune du Château Premier Cru  (Beaune),92,42.0,13,Roger Voss,Chardonnay,2005.0
9777,"For a Savigny, this is surprisingly firm and tannic, the wine's structure an impressive edifice of dry tannins and firm cranberry and plum skin flavors. It is certainly ripe, the fruit promising attractive richness in 3–5 years, followed by good aging potential.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),92,43.0,13,Roger Voss,Pinot Noir,2005.0
9778,"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins.

9779,"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",Dr. H.

9780,"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun.

9781,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit.

9782,"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking.",Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),92,42.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Cabernet Franc,2006.0
9783,"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages.

9784,"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished.

9785,"The Rust style of ultra-sweet wine is all about wonderful honey and toffee flavors over intense acidity, a great balancing act of spice, dry botrytis and great sweetness.

9786,"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class.

9787,"A wine that is on the cusp of adding an extra element of complexity. At present, there is deliciously perfumed fruit, white and green currants and white peaches, with a definite citrus edge.

Iijima,Riesling,2014.0
9790,"A wine that's had some time to find itself in bottle, this opens in a wildness of mountain tannin and dusty texture, grippy and dry on the palate.

9792,"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix.

9798,"Lush candied fruits abound in this naturally botrytised wine. With 147 g/L of residual sugar, it still reaches over 12% alcohol.

9799,"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity.

These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful.

The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more.

9902,"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously.

9905,"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring.

9908,"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice.

9910,"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age.

9911,"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine.

9985,"Pretty coffee notes are offset by ripe aromas of raspberry, black cherry and chocolate: There is nice softness and density in this wine that is balanced against the natural acidity of the fruit. Pair this wine with cheesy pasta al forno.",Marchesi Alfieri 2007 La Tota  (Barbera d'Asti),89,28.0,197,,Barbera,2007.0
9986,"Pretty sharp in tannins and acids, even for a Stags Leap Cab. Although it has plenty of blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, it's a hard wine. The palate finds so much to like, it wants it to be softer, but it's not, so the gamble is on aging. Try after 2013.",Martin Ray 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),89,45.0,26,,Cabernet Sauvignon,2007.0
9987,"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine.",Milbrandt 2006 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),89,25.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Merlot,2006.0
9988,"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),89,37.0,26,,Zinfandel,2007.0
9989,"Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar. Try 2012–2020, although this wine has a track record that suggests longer aging isn't out of the question.",Penfolds 2006 Bin 389 Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa),89,37.0,58,Joe Czerwinski,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,2006.0
9990,"A soft, easygoing style of Marlborough Sauvignon, the 2009 Ponga exhibits ripe, almost honeyed, stone-fruit aromas that slide easily into melon and nectarine flavors marked by only a touch of grassiness.",Ponga 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),89,18.0,29,Joe Czerwinski,Sauvignon Blanc,2009.0
9991,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.",Roessler 2008 Griffin's Lair Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),89,46.0,26,,Pinot Noir,2008.0
9992,"Smoky and savory, with sharp acidity under black cherry fruit. It's still pulling itself together, but the weight and balance are there, showing hints of tobacco leaf, mint and herb.",Seven Hills 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),89,22.0,85,Paul Gregutt,Tempranillo,2007.0
9993,"The style at Domaines Ott has changed to become fresher and less oxidative, and the wine fits the new look. It is vivid, crisp, a rich texture giving fresh berry fruit and a light layer of acidity.",Domaines Ott 2009 Château de Selle Rosé (Côtes de Provence),89,43.0,59,Roger Voss,Rosé,2009.0
9994,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",Robert Mondavi 2010 To Kalon Vineyard I Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville),91,75.0,26,,Fumé Blanc,2010.0
9995,"As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go—rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.",Henri de Villamont 2010 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin),91,52.0,13,Roger Voss,Pinot Noir,2010.0
9996,"This is a smooth, ripe, and rounded wine that's intense on the palate with bright red-fruit flavors. Integrated acidity and hints of maturity add balance to rich fruitiness. Reserve wines blended into the Champagne lend a fullness to the palate that makes the wine ready to drink now.",Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),91,,38,Roger Voss,Pinot Noir,
