It's still pulling itself together, but the weight and balance are there, showing hints of tobacco leaf, mint and herb.",,89,22.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),Tempranillo,2007
9997,9997.0,France,"The style at Domaines Ott has changed to become fresher and less oxidative, and the wine fits the new look. It is vivid, crisp, a rich texture giving fresh berry fruit and a light layer of acidity.",Château de Selle,89,43.0,Provence,Roger Voss,Domaines Ott 2009 Château de Selle Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Rosé,2009
9998,9998.0,US,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",To Kalon Vineyard I Block,91,75.0,California,,Robert Mondavi 2010 To Kalon Vineyard I Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville),Fumé Blanc,2010
9999,9999.0,France,"As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go—rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.",Les Evocelles,91,52.0,Burgundy,Roger Voss,Henri de Villamont 2010 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,2010
10000,10000.0,France,"This is a smooth, ripe, and rounded wine that's intense on the palate with bright red-fruit flavors. Integrated acidity and hints of maturity add balance to rich fruitiness. Reserve wines blended into the Champagne lend a fullness to the palate that makes the wine ready to drink now.",Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut,91,,Champagne,Roger Voss,Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,Нет данных
